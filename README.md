## Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science at University of Southern California.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on 
  - a news scraping project
  - a discord bot
  - learning ios app dev using UIKit with [Jack Xu](https://github.com/boyuanx)
  - updating class rating website [ratemyelectives](https://ratemyelectives.com/) to use Django and React

I'm also trying to get more involved in contributing to open source projects to expand my skills
